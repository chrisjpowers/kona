h1. Kona - A JavaScript Binding Library

The goal of Kona is to give JavaScript developers a lightweight binding framework that can be added
mid-project (as opposed to something like SproutCore or Backbone). Kona ships with a set of bindable
data objects, plus the $.kona method for binding UI elements to these data objects.

For example usage, please see the example directory.
